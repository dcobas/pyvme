To extract drivergen information from Oracle for a given
named driver just type

./makeregs.bat <name>

where <name> is the name of the driver (usually must be upper case)
the makeregs.bat builds the regs file

<name>.regs

this file can build a library when fed into genlib

Example:

./makeregs.bat CVORB

more CVORB.regs

============

If you supply an extra split parameter value as follows ...

./makeregs.bat <name> <value>

all offset values less than the split parameter go in window 1
all greater or equal offsets get put in window 2 ond the offset
is adjusted by the split value.

So if you call ./makeregs.bat CVORB 0x20
then everything below 0x20 goes in window 1
and all offsets greater than or equal get 0x20 subtracted
and put in window 2.
This is needed because of the brain dead way drivergen
used to work with flat memory spaces ... don't ask !
