The module parameters are vectors that must all be the same length,
or simply not used (length = 0). For each lun, the driver may
have a level, vector, and at least one VME base address to
create the address map. Each window size and address modifier
is normally the same for each lun and is specified once or not
at all.

dname, In order to avoid recompiling the driver it is possible
       to define its name via this parameter rather than in
       the users parameter file. This means the same kernel
       object can be used multiple times.

luns, Logical unit numbers (not optional)
lvls, Interrupt levels (either not specified or one for each lun)
vecs, Interrupt vectors (same as lvls)
vme1, First VME base address (not optional)
vme2, Second VME base address (either not specified or one for each lun)

These parameters would normally be specified once per lun.
In this case the driver will use the first value for all luns.
There is no restriction however in the driver from specifying
them individually for each lun should that be usefull. It may
be interesting for example to map one module and use only DMA
access for all the others.

amd1, First address modifier (not optional, at least one specified)
amd2, Second address modifier (optional)
dwd1, First data width (not optional, at least one specified)
dwd2, Second data width (optional)
win1, First window size (not optional, at least one specified)
win2, Second window size (optional)
nmap, No map window flag, 1=DMA only (defaults to zero)
isrc, Location of interrupt source reg in vme1 (optional)

Installation via insmod parameters example

Example: cp vmeio.ko mytest.ko
         insmod mytest.ko dname="mytest"
                          luns= 136,   99,    46
                          vme1= 0x100, 0x200, 0x300
                          amd1= 0x29 win1=0x10 dwd1=2

Example: insmod ctrv.ko luns= 1,         2,
                        vme1= 0xC100000, 0xC200000
                        vme2= 0x100,     0x200
                        lvls= 2,         2
                        vecs= 0xC8,      0xC9
                        amd1= 0x39
                        amd2= 0x29
                        win1= 0x10000
                        win2= 0x100
                        dwd1= 4
                        dwd2= 2
                        isrc= 0
