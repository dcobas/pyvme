To extract drivergen information from Oracle for a given
named driver just type

./makeregs.bat <name>

where <name> is the name of the driver (usually must be upper case)
the makeregs.bat builds the regs file

<name>.regs

this file can build a library when fed into genlib

Example:

./makeregs.bat CVORB

more CVORB.regs
