Makeinstall.bat goes to /acc/dsc/<accelerator>/<front-end>/etc/transfer.ref
and extracts information from this file to build a driver install script for
the driver with name <NAME> in the local file: install.<NAME>

As not all information is in the transfer.ref file concerning interrupts, it
may be required to edit the file to add the options you want.
Some options not set up are ...

   lvls=<interrupt levels>
   vecs=<interrupt vectors>
   isrc=<interrupt register offset>  isrc is optional

./makeinstall.bat <NAME> <accelerator> <front-end>

Example: ./makeinstall.bat VD80 tst cfv-864-cdv28

This would generate the script: install.VD80

==============================

The doinstall.bat file is intended to be run on an actual front-end.
It uses the transfer.ref in /etc and after generating the script it
then runs it. The script requires that <name>.ko is present in the
current directory.

in /usr/local/drivers/<name/ the following files are required
geninstall.awk
doinstall.bat
<name>.ko

To install the driver named VD80 do this

cd /usr/local/drivers/vd80
./doinstall VD80

N.B. There is no write access allowed to /usr from typical front-end
computers. All temporary files reside in /tmp
