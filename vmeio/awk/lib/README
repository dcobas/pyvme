To generate a library type

./makelib.bat <NAME>

where <NAME> is the name of your driver in uppercase.

The file <NAME>.regs should exist.
If the driver is described in Oracle in the drivergen tables
it can be generated automatically as follows ...

cd ./regs
./makeregs.bat <NAME>
cp <NAME>.regs ..
cd ..

then

to make the driver install file

cd install
Follow that readme
