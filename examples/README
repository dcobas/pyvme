These examples were generated by the following commands

./drvencore rf_vtu
./drvencore cvora L865 2.6.24.7-rt27 CVORA.regs

Notice that in cvora the regs file is hand made, but in rf_vtu it gets generated from the Oracle data

The userlib directory contains the dal library I made by hand for the ctc module
